# calendar


vue calendar project. here I use vue-full-calendar for calendar layout and vue-bootstrap for styling. Added methots to save, delete, edit events in calendar. You can drag and drop events on different days. You can also add event types and color them so you know better which event you looking for. I also added event list? where you can serch for events, sort them, filter by type, edit and delete. Event are saved to localStorage
